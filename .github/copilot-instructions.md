# Copilot Instructions for this Repository

## Project Overview

This repository is in its initial stages. Use this file to document project-specific guidance for AI agents as the codebase grows.

## Getting Started

- **Repository**: GitHub repository at sojeong-superbullet/test
- **Current State**: Minimal project structure - README.md with basic documentation
- **Primary Branch**: main

## Architecture & Components

*To be populated as the project develops. Document:*
- Major components and their responsibilities
- Key service boundaries and data flows
- Architectural decisions and rationale

## Development Workflows

*Document when available:*
- Build commands and process
- Test execution and coverage requirements
- Local development setup steps
- Debugging procedures

## Conventions & Patterns

*Add project-specific patterns:*
- File organization and naming conventions
- Code style preferences (beyond standard linters)
- Common design patterns used in this project
- Error handling and logging conventions

## Key Files & Directories

└── .git/                  # Version control
```

## Integration Points

*Document as the project develops:*
- External dependencies and APIs
- Cross-component communication patterns
- Environment configuration requirements

## Important Notes for AI Agents

- This is a new project - establish foundational patterns early
- Prioritize clear file structure and documentation
- Update this guide as significant features or patterns are added

## How to Update This Guide

When implementing major features or structural changes:
1. Add specific examples from the actual codebase
2. Document workflows that aren't obvious from files alone
3. Reference key files that exemplify important patterns
4. Remove generic advice - focus on THIS project's needs
